Question 1:

I have found that the output of this circuit is true when
only three of the four inputs are true, by individually
changing the inputs to represent the 16 combinations 
possible for input for this circuit. My thinking in
solving this problem was to put three xor gates together
so they outputted true if an odd number of gates were
positive, and then make a separate part which determined
if less than two inputs were powered so that the case of
one input high could be filtered out, and put an and gate
between these two parts so that the output was only high
when three inputs were high, which seems to have worked.


Question 2:

After testing all 4 combinations of inputs after creating
the XOR subcircuit, it seems to perform as expected. My
thinking was to make a set of two transistors for every
combination of inputs, and have them output either a high
or low voltage only when the correct input is put in, and
then string their outputs together to get one functional
circuit, which seems to have worked to produce a
functioning XOR gate.
